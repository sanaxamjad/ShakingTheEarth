## Description

Our project, titled "Shaking the Earth: An Exploration of Global Earthquake Activity in 2020," aims to provide users with an in-depth understanding of the earthquakes that occurred worldwide in January 2020. It caters to users interested in researching earthquake patterns and anyone curious about earthquake data.

### Main Components and Details

#### API
We utilized the USGS Earthquake Catalog API to fetch earthquake data for the specified time period. The API link used in our project is: [USGS Earthquake Catalog API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02)

#### Visualizations
Our project primarily focuses on a map visualization. We used the leaflet.js library, which provides an interactive and customizable map component for displaying earthquake data. With this map, users can explore the locations and details of the earthquakes that occurred in January 2020. The map includes features such as zooming, panning, and marker pop-ups displaying earthquake information.

#### CSS Frameworks
We employed Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of our project. Bootstrap ensured that our project's interface is user-friendly and compatible across different devices and screen sizes.

### Project Objective

The primary objective of our project is to provide users with comprehensive insights into earthquake activity worldwide during January 2020. By visualizing the earthquake data on an interactive map, users can explore the distribution, magnitude, and other relevant information about the earthquakes that occurred during that period. This exploration aims to deepen users' understanding of seismic events and their impact on different regions across the globe.
